📘 Feb Internship 2026 – Function with Loops (Task 4)
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains solutions for Task 4 of the Data Science Internship – February 2026.
The objective of this task is to understand and implement Python functions and loops in real-world scenarios.

Each problem is designed to simulate practical systems such as recharge validation, inventory management, student evaluation, fare calculation, attendance tracking, and password validation.

🎯 Concepts Used

Python Functions

While Loop

For Loop

Conditional Statements (if-else)

Dictionary Handling

List Operations

String Validation

📝 Problems Implemented
1️⃣ Mobile Recharge Validation System

Validates recharge amount.

Checks if the selected plan is valid.

Allows retry using a while loop.

Simulates telecom recharge applications.

2️⃣ Inventory Reorder Alert System

Accepts product stock in dictionary format.

Displays "Reorder Alert" if stock is below threshold.

Uses for loop to iterate through products.

Represents warehouse and retail systems.

3️⃣ Student Result Processing System

Accepts a list of student marks.

Calculates average marks.

Returns Pass/Fail based on average.

Demonstrates academic result evaluation logic.

4️⃣ Cab Fare Estimator with Retry Option

Calculates fare using:

Base Fare

Distance charges

Peak hour surcharge

Allows user retry using while loop.

Simulates ride-hailing fare calculation systems.

5️⃣ Employee Attendance Eligibility Checker

Calculates attendance percentage.

Returns eligibility status based on 75% rule.

Represents HR and payroll systems.

6️⃣ Password Strength Checker

Validates password based on:

Minimum length

Presence of digits

Special characters (@#$)

Demonstrates basic security validation logic.

💻 Tools Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

GitHub


🚀 Learning Outcome

Through this task, I strengthened my understanding of:

Writing reusable functions

Using loops efficiently

Applying logic in real-world problem solving

Structuring clean and readable Python code
